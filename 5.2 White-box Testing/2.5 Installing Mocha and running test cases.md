# Installing Mocha and running test cases

## Overview

It is a general tendency of a developer to make the code work at the time of testing. This is why there is a lot of focus on Negative and Corner Case testing to thoroughly test your code.

## Learning Outcome

- What is Happy path testing?
- What is negative testing?
- How to perform corner case testing?

## Introduction 

We need to understand that happy path testing is generally always done during testing. Negative and Corner Case testing gains a lot of weightage because it tends to get missed and this is where majority of bugs arise when the software goes live.
