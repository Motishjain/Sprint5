# Deep dive into Mocha and Chai

## Overview
MochaJs Test framework has many capabilities which a developer can use to write unit tests for his code.

## Learning Outcome

- How to test synchronous and asynchronous code?
- What is negative testing?
- How to perform corner case testing?

## Introduction 

Mocha runs the test cases serially and provides very accurate reporting. Also, it makes testing asynchronous code,which is a part of almost all Javascript applications, easy and efficient.

It is important to note that Mocha does not have a built in assertion library therefore Chai assertion library is commonly used with Mocha.
