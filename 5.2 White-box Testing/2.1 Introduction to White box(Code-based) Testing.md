# Introduction to White box(Code-based) Testing

## Overview

White box testing is also known as Open Box testing. It is called so because it is generally the developer who performs whitebox testing and the code is open in front of him. 

In most of the development teams in reputed companies, you are **not supposed to commit (submit)** any code unless you have written unit tests along with it.
With this I hope you understand the importance of unit testing. 

White-box doesn't necessarily test the entire system end to end but it makes sure different pieces of the application are working fine.
