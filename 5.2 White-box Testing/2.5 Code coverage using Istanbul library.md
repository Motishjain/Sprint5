# Code coverage using Istanbul library

## Overview

While writing unit tests it is very important to make sure all code is tested with unit tests. 

Istanbul library helps to check the code coverage us to identify the untested code and write test cases for them.

## Introduction 

Istanbul is a Javascript code coverage tool written in JS. Code coverage is a simple measurement of the percentage of our source code that was executed during a cycle of automated tests..                                                                                                    

It is important to note that Code coverage is only a guarantee that some percentage of lines/paths/branches of code was executed. However, it doesnâ€™t mean that those lines/paths/branches were tested in every configuration/situation.
