# Positive, Negative and Corner Cases

## Overview

It is a general tendency of a developer to make the code work at the time of testing. This is why there is a lot of focus on Negative and Corner Case testing to thoroughly test your code.

Let's take the same example of IRCTC. Try to figure out which type of testing below is -

1. Login and test if you can search your train and book tickets. Logout should work after booking.
2. Test if you can put a From Date **after the** To Date while searching trains. Also make sure you test What happens if I do not enter passenger names and click Book.
3. Test if tatkal booking system works fine when 1,00,000 customers are trying to book their tickets. 

The 2nd and 3rd type of testing sounds unusual right? That's right. This is why most of the developers tend to miss testing the negative and corner cases. 

## Learning Outcome

- What is Happy path testing?
- What is negative testing?
- How to perform corner case testing?

## Introduction 

We need to understand that happy path testing is generally always done during testing. Negative and Corner Case testing gains a lot of weightage because it tends to get missed and this is where majority of bugs arise when the software goes live.

We need to make sure all the negative scenarios are tested thoroughly just like positive test cases.
