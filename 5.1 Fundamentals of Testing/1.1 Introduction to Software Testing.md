# Introduction to Software Testing

## Overview

When I used to do programming in my college days, I used to test with 2-3 test cases and with that I would be happy that my program is working fine.
However, while working in industry I realized that testing can be performed in so many different ways and each way results in finding interesting bugs in the application. It becomes fun when you write an automated test to run and then you can play with the system while testing. 

Nowadays, many companies are hiring developers who are also expected to write automated test cases to test their piece of code and also to test the end to end behavior of the system.

## Introduction
Software Testing is an art of investigating the software to ensure that the requirements of the client are in line with how the software works. Testing in reality needs a destructive mindset towards the system to try different scenarios to find defects in the system.

Any amount of code is useless if it does not work as per the expectations of the end user. The end user can either be a person or another software which uses our developed software.
