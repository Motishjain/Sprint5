## Introduction
Functional Testing is validating the system against a guideline or the functional document defined as per the requirements of the end user. In simple terms you can remember it as **What?** of the system.

Non-Functional Testing is testing the parameters of the system which define the user experience like for e.g. How much time it takes for a user to login to the application. In simple terms you can remember it as the **How?** of the system.
