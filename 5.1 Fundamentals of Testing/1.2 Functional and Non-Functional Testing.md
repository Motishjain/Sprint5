# Functional and Non-Functional Testing

## Overview

There are two major and broad categories of Software Testing i.e. Functional and Non-Functional Testing.

Both of these types of testing say something like below. Try to figure out the riddle - 

1. "I am very sensitive in nature. I get very irritated when security is compromised or if the application is not easy to use. If the application takes more than 30 seconds to login I would never use it again." 

2. "I look for what the system does and I am very serious in nature. I don't like it when any functionality of the application doesn't work."
   

## Learning Outcome

- What is Functional Testing?
- What is Non-Functional Testing?

## Introduction
Functional Testing is validating the system against a guideline or the functional document defined as per the requirements of the end user. In simple terms you can remember it as **What?** of the system.

Non-Functional Testing is testing the parameters of the system which define the user experience like for e.g. How much time it takes for a user to login to the application. In simple terms you can remember it as the **How?** of the system.

Understanding both the types of testing helps us test different aspects of the software.
