# Understanding different Levels of Functional Testing

## Overview

As a developer, you need to understand how to perform testing at every level to make sure the software is robust.

Sounds boring? Let's take an example. Suppose you are told to test the Ticket Booking functionality of IRCTC. Now lets see what every level of testing has to say - 

1. All the developers should test single pieces of code (like Search trains, book seats, cancel seats) individually - "Unit Testing" 
2. Test end to end scenarios like searching the train and booking seats with passenger names - "Integration testing"
3. Test the entire system functionality starting from login to logout (including cancel, boarding, everything). - "System testing"
4. ... 
5. ...
6. ... (Try to go through this topic and write down what you think can be different scenarios which can be tested for IRCTC website)

- What is Software Testing?
- Why is Software testing so important?
- What is manual and automation testing?

## Introduction 

Starting with testing a single line of code to testing the entire application end to end, Functional testing is done at various levels to identify the issues at different stages.

There are different stages of testing like Integration, System, Regression, etc which are named in the increasing order of scope.

A developer can test the small pieces of code like a method definition using unit test cases. This is the first level of testing. As the level increase, we move closer towards how the customer is going to use it in real-time.
