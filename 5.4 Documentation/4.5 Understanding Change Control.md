# 5.5 Understanding Change Control

## Overview

Once all your documentation is done and you are all set to start development and testing your application, your product manager comes and says "Hey I have some new requirements for our application".

Let's say in Facebook, the product manager would have reached out to the development team at some point to say we need to add below new functionalities - 
- Check in your place with your status.
- Add emotions along with Like button on any post.
- Have a separate messenger app downloaded for messaging on Facebook

Now what about the documentation you did already for the same components? You need to go through a process of systematically updating the document and go through the approvals process again for the new document.

At the end of the changes completed and approved, you provide a new version to your document.

All the testing should be reconsidered again after making changes to any functional or technical document.
