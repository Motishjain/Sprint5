## Introduction 

Test documentation is documentation of artifacts created before or during the testing of software.  

It is a complete suite of documents that allows you to describe and document test planning, test design, test execution, test results that are drawn from the testing activity.
If all this is not documented, the testing gets very unorganized and it becomes difficult to track the testing being performed. 

This might sound exaggerated but when you work to build and test complex software systems, it is literally impossible to get the quality assurance of the software without Documentation.
