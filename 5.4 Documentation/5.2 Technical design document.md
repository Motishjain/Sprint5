# Technical design document (TDD)

## Overview

After all the requirements of the application are clear and ready to be implemented, developers generally should create a technical design document (TDD) which mentions how the system is designed and it's architecture.

Imagine your team has created the entire application of IRCTC and Ajay joins your development team. Now you want to explain to Ajay how the application is structured and what is the entire flow in the code.

You might tell him something like this?
- Go through the entire code (which has 500 files in it)?
- Read all the comments in every class and try to understand the flow?
- Do some guess work like Inky Pinky Ponky and find the right class? Haha

All the above as it sounds it doesn't work. Ajay would think why did I join such a company.

This is just one reason mentioning about the new joinee. Apart from this there are various other reasons to have a TDD in place to understand at any point what the system architecture is.

## Introduction 

A technical design doc describes a solution to a given technical problem. It is a specification, or “design blueprint”, for a software program or feature.

It can have sequence diagram, block diagram, flowcharts, written description about the various aspects of the system.
