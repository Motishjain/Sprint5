# Understanding different Levels of Functional Testing

## Overview

Now it's time to understand how to write test cases to test the system end to end keeping the functional specs and non functional attributes of the system in mind.

## Learning Outcome

- What should be understood thoroughly before starting to write functional specs?
- How to understand a functional spec thoroughly?
- Understanding use case diagram of the system?

## Introduction 
A functional specification is a formal document used to describe a product's intended capabilities and interactions with different users of the system.

It is kind of a guideline and continuing reference point as the developers write the programming code.

## What must you do?
- Read this interesting article to understand [what is a functional spec and it's importance](https://www.itomic.com.au/what-is-a-functional-specification-and-why-is-it-important/).
